## ðŸŒŸ Author

I am [Srikanth Tangella](https://github.com/sreee2001) and I am an Software Engineer with many years of Experience in Desktop software
After so many years of programming, I created a set of reference projects for Entity Framework using C# Dotnet Framework.
The purpose is to log my research and provide easy to grab snippets and or base projects for future use

- [TestingCodeFirst_FirstProject](./02_Examples/TestingCodeFirst_FirstProject) : An example from Microsoft on Code first EF

### [Demo](./Demo)
